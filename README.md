# BigDataFinalProject
This repository is for the final project of ME-5013, Big Data Analytics in Extreme Environments

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the course objectives of handling and analysing large datasets through the use of Python libraries.
The data chosen for this purpose is calculated values of pressure, temperature, and normalized column density for carbon monoxide (C0) from the
exhaust of a rotating detonation engine (RDE) while under operation.  The data sets are representative of 4 separate runs of the RDE under varying
equivalence ratios and mass flow rates.  The author of this project has hypothesized that there is a correlation between the amount of CO generated
and these two quanities.
